## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javscript

### What I learned

I learned to create my own interactive elements with html and javascript, rather then relying on existing components and libraries such as bootstrap, which would have made the solution much quicker, but I would not have learned as much along the way.
